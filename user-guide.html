                        <p><strong>Write an Email with AI:</strong> When viewing a contact, click the AI icon next to their email address. In the compose window, provide a simple prompt (e.g., "Follow up on our call and mention the new pricing"), and the AI will draft a professional email for you to review, edit, and send.</p>
